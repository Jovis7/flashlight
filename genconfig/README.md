# Updating the embedded configuration

To update the embedded proxies as well as the global config, simply run:

```
./genconfig.bash
```

That will generate a number of files, but **the only ones that matter are ../config/generated/embeddedGlobal.go and ../config/generated/embeddedProxies.go**, and the script will automatically add those files for you to manually commit.

The embeddedGlobal.go is generated by downloading the current global.yaml from
the cloud. So, to make changes to the embedded global.yaml, first make them to
the cloud version (see https://github.com/getlantern/lantern_aws/blob/master/salt/update_masquerades/original.txt)
and then embed them from here.
