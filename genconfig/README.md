# Updating the embedded configuration

If you want to update the global proxied sites list, first edit the global file at
https://github.com/getlantern/lantern_aws/blob/master/salt/update_masquerades/original.txt

As of this writing that gets pulled from [every hour on the hour](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern_aws/blob/master/salt/update_masquerades/init.sls#L48) into global.yaml, so you'll want to make sure it's actually updated before pulling it into the client. You can check that with:

`curl --head https://globalconfig.flashlightproxy.com/global.yaml.gz`

The embeddedGlobal.go is generated by downloading that file.

To only update that file, you can run:

```
genglobal.bash
```

Just the proxies is:

```
genproxies.bash
```

To update the embedded proxies as well as the global config, simply run:

```
./genconfig.bash
```

That will generate a number of files, but **the only ones that matter are ../config/generated/embeddedGlobal.go and ../config/generated/embeddedProxies.go**, and the script will automatically add those files for you to manually commit.
